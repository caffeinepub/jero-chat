  "summary": "Expanding \"Jero chat\" from a UI-only prototype into a v1 chat app scope including login/auth (login shown first), contacts/friends to start chats, private & group chats, media/file sharing, message status, notifications, profile/settings, WhatsApp-like audio/video calling, plus a WhatsApp/Instagram-like \"Status/Stories\" feature (viewing behavior, audience visibility rules, and allowed post types), exclusive CEO/Admin features and an install/download flow.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "CEO/admin login should not depend on email; use phone OTP or passkey (per selected Option 1).",
    "Attachment upload limits cannot be truly unlimited on Internet Computer; user requested a 1 GB max limit, which may exceed canister/message/storage constraints and likely requires alternative storage/chunking strategy.",
    "Clarify and enforce profile photo upload constraints: user requested a 100 MP (megapixel) limit; may require client-side validation (image decode to read dimensions/MP) and corresponding backend checks if images are stored/processed server-side.",
    "Status/Stories currently disallow audio statuses; adding “music for post” conflicts with existing allowed post types and needs a clarified rule (e.g., background music allowed on photo/video vs. standalone audio status).",
    "Adding “music from online” requires defining source type (URL vs catalog/search), streaming/playback approach, and addressing licensing/availability; may need storing only a link/metadata rather than uploading audio.",
    "Presence/online status requires a definition and mechanism (e.g., heartbeat/last-seen timestamp with TTL) since Internet Computer canisters do not provide automatic real-time presence; decide polling interval and what counts as “online” vs “offline/last seen”.",
    "Clarify expected navigation: after adding/selecting a contact, app should open the chat thread and remain on the chat page with persisted history loaded.",
    "Define and implement “Last seen” semantics for web presence (timestamp update rules, inactivity timeout/TTL, privacy/visibility) and how it’s computed from activity/requests."
  ],
  "known_issues": [
    "Image mockup generation was requested but no image was actually produced/returned.",
    "User requested APK/download link, but current deployment is web-app only; needs packaging/distribution approach.",
    "Recent build attempt failed/\"didn’t go through\"; needs retry with simplified scope or diagnosis.",
    "User requested increasing attachment max file size limit to 1 GB; may be infeasible on current Internet Computer backend without major changes (e.g., chunking/external storage).",
    "Profile screen: Save button is not working (profile changes are not being saved).",
    "After adding a contact (by principal ID or phone), the app does not navigate/move to the chat page as expected.",
    "Online status indicator shows users as offline even when they are actively online on the web app.",
    "Chat history is not consistently shown/persisted when staying in a chat thread (needs verification against expected persisted history behavior)."
